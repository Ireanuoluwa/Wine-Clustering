## Wine Clustering with Unsupervised Learning Models.

The Wine Clustering with Unsupervised Learning project focuses on clustering wines based on their properties using unsupervised learning techniques. The dataset used is unlabeled and contains various characteristics of wines. The analysis employs K-means clustering and Agglomerative clustering to group similar wine observations.

To get started, the repository provides instructions for cloning the project, installing dependencies, and preparing the dataset. The K-means clustering algorithm partitions the dataset into k clusters, while the Agglomerative clustering algorithm merges clusters hierarchically based on similarity.

The results of the analysis reveal distinct clusters of wines based on their properties. These clusters offer insights into the similarities and differences among the wines, aiding in understanding the underlying structure of the dataset. The project suggests future improvements such as feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, algorithm selection and tuning, visualization, and external validation measures.

In conclusion, the Wine Clustering with Unsupervised Learning project provides a foundation for clustering wines based on their properties. It offers potential applications in wine classification and recommendation systems, contributing to a deeper understanding of wine characteristics and facilitating decision-making processes.
